#Structure Web Page With HTML
##Reflection

A wireframe is a low-fidelity mockup of a website or app interface. It is used to visualize the layout of the interface and the placement
of different elements, such as text, images, and buttons. Wireframes are typically created in black and white, without any styling or design elements. 
This helps the focus to remain on the structure and functionality of the interface.

Design is the process of creating a visually appealing and user-friendly interface. It involves making decisions about the layout, typography, colors, 
and images used in the interface. Design should also take into account the user experience, and ensure that the interface is easy to use and navigate.

HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard markup language for creating web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page and how it should be displayed.

To create an HTML document, you need to create a file with the .html extension. The file should start with the following declaration
Semantics is the study of meaning. It is a subfield of linguistics that examines how words and phrases convey meaning. Semantics is concerned with 
the relationship between language and the world, and how language is used to communicate meaning.

1. What is HTML and why do we use it?

-HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content

Consists of a series of elements, used to enclose (wrap) content to make it appear or act a certain way
A tag is used for creating an element
The name of an HTML element is the name that appears at the beginning of the element's start tag and at the end of the element's end tag (if the element has an end tag)
Example: The p in the <p> start tag and </p> end tag is the name of the HTML paragraph element.

2. What are the 3 main parts of an HTML element?

Anatomy of HTML Element

A typical HTML element includes:

Opening tag with some attributes:
Opening tag consists of the name of the element, wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets and states where the elment begins or starts to take effect
Attributes contain extra information about the element
Enclosed text content: in this case, is just text
Closing tag: States where the element ends â€” in this case where the paragraph ends.

3. What is it called when you give an element extra information?

Attributes contain extra information about the element that you don't want to appear in the actual content
Example below:
<p class ="editor-note">My cat is very grumpy</p>
The class is the attribute name and editor-note is the attribute value
The class attribute allows you to give the element a non-unique identifier that can be used to target it (and other elements with the same class value) with style information and other things

4. What is a semantic element?

Semantic elements give the text it wraps around its role (or meaning)

When deciding which markup to use, ask "What element(s) best describe/represent the data that I'm going to populate?" then select the semantic element most appropriate for the job

Example: h1 element gives the text instruction of "a top level heading on your page"

<h1>This is a top level heading</h1>
By adding semantic HTML tags to your pages, you provide additional information that helps define the roles and relative importance of the different parts of your page
Examples of semantic elements
<article>
<aside>
<details>
<figcaption>
<figure>
<footer>
<form>
<header>
<main>
<mark>
<nav>
<section>
<summary>
<time>
Examples of elements that are not semantic
<head>
<b>
<span>
<div>
Benefits from writing semantic markup
Search engines will consider its contents as important keywords to influence the page's search rankings (see SEO)
Enables accessibility (e.g., screen readers can use it as a signpost to help visually impaired users navigate a page)
Finding blocks of meaningful code is significantly easier
Suggests to the developer the type of data that will be populated
Semantic naming mirrors proper custom element/component naming
