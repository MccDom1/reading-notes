## 6 Reasons for Pair Programming

1. What are the 6 reasons for pair programming?
-Greater Code Quality:

Two minds working together can catch errors and produce higher-quality code.
Knowledge Sharing:

Pair programming facilitates the sharing of knowledge and skills among team members.
Team Building:

It fosters a sense of teamwork and collaboration among developers.
Increased Productivity:

Despite the perception of reduced speed, pair programming often leads to faster delivery due to fewer bugs and better-designed solutions.
Improved Focus:

Having a partner can help maintain focus and prevent distractions.
Immediate Feedback:

Developers receive instant feedback on their code, which can lead to faster issue resolution.


2. In your experience, which of these reasons have you found most beneficial?
-he immediate feedback and knowledge-sharing aspects of pair programming to be particularly beneficial. It can enhance code quality and collaboration within a team.


3. How does pair programming work?
-Pair programming involves two developers working at one workstation. There are two roles:

Driver:

The person actively writing code.
Observer/Navigator:

The person reviewing each line of code as it's written, suggesting improvements, and thinking about the overall strategy.
The roles can be switched frequently to ensure both members actively contribute to the codebase. It's a dynamic process where both individuals share responsibilities.
