## Readings: REST

Understanding teamwork and communication: The article "What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team" delves into the importance of psychological safety in team dynamics. This knowledge can help you foster more collaborative and productive working relationships with your peers in future projects.

RESTful APIs: The article "How I explained REST to my brother" and the questions about HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH) equip you with the fundamentals of building and interacting with web APIs. APIs are the backbone of modern web applications, and understanding RESTful principles will be crucial for data exchange and communication between different parts of your software.

Real-world application: The API keys you requested from Geocoding, WeatherBit, Yelp, and The Movie DB open doors to real-world data and functionality. By incorporating these APIs into your projects, you'll gain practical experience in consuming external data, enriching your applications, and building dynamic user experiences.

Independent learning and exploration: The resources you provided encourage you to explore beyond the classroom. You'll need to actively seek information, grasp new concepts, and apply them to practical scenarios. This fosters independent learning, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills, all of which are valuable assets for any developer.

In essence, all these elements contribute to building your software development toolbox. You'll gain valuable knowledge about teamwork, communication, web APIs, data integration, and independent learning. These are fundamental skills that will empower you to tackle complex challenges, build innovative applications, and thrive in the ever-evolving world of software development.

If you’ve read this before, skim this article again for a refresher.

1. To what extent did psychological safety impact your previous work experience?
- In every aspect psychological safety impacted my work experience . Mental health is such a gray area in society these days. I’ve had to work with people who have been diagnosed with mental illnesses. I’ve had to work with people who have been diagnosed with depression. I’ve had to work with people who have been diagnosed with PTSD. I’ve had to work with people who have been diagnosed with anxiety. I’ve had to work with people who have been diagnosed with you name it right. And everyday you have to adapt to that enviornment.


2. How does this article inform your approach to working with others moving forward?
- The article is a great example of how to work with others. It’s not about how to work with others, but how to work with yourself and others. It’s about how to work with yourself and others. 


How I explained REST to my brother

1. Who is Roy Fielding?
-Roy Fielding is an American computer scientist who played a pivotal role in developing the internet's infrastructure.


2. Why don’t the techniques that we use in this class work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?
-Heterogeneity: Machines in the world have diverse capabilities, operating systems, and protocols. A technique tailored for one type might not translate well to another.
Limited resources: Some machines have limited processing power, storage, or network bandwidth. Techniques requiring high resources might be impractical or impossible.
Security concerns: Some machines may have strict security restrictions, preventing them from running certain code or interacting with external services.
Standardization: To ensure universal communication, standardized protocols like HTTP are crucial. Techniques relying on custom protocols or APIs might not be widely understood.



3. What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?
-HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a stateless application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. It defines how messages are formatted and exchanged between clients (web browsers) and servers (web servers) to access and manipulate resources on the internet.





4. What does a GET do?
-A GET request is used to retrieve data from a server. It's the most common HTTP method, used for fetching web pages, images, and other resources. You're likely using GET when you visit a website and see its content.





5. What does a POST do?
-A POST request submits data to a server. It's used for creating new resources, sending information, or performing actions on the server. For example, posting a comment on a website or submitting a form uses a POST request.




6. What does PUT do?
-A PUT request replaces the entire state of a resource on the server with the data provided in the request. It's used to update existing resources completely. For example, updating your profile information or editing a document might use PUT.


7. What does PATCH do?
-A PATCH request applies partial modifications to a resource on the server. It sends only the changes you want to make, unlike PUT, which replaces everything. This is useful for updating specific fields or attributes without affecting the entire resource. For example, changing your password or liking a post might use PATCH.




API Keys
Request a personal API key from the following APIs. You should receive these in your email within a few hours, often within minutes. Please request these keys prior to lecture to allow adequate time because you will need them in order to complete your lab assignment. Note: do not post your API keys in the Canvas discussion or on GitHub. Save them in a secure place.
