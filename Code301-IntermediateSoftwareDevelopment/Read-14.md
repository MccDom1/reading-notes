## Consider the history: That Time When Women Stopped Coding

1. What occurred during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer science?
- The decline of women in computer science coincides with the rise of personal computers in the 1980s. This was a period when computer usage shifted from professional settings to homes, becoming increasingly associated with gaming and hobbies.

2. Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?
- During this time, males had greater access to computers and technology due to societal factors and marketing strategies. This created a perception of computer science as a "masculine" field, discouraging young women from pursuing it.
With fewer women working in computer science, there were fewer role models to inspire young girls. This lack of representation further perpetuated the stereotype of a male-dominated field.

3. Review the data: Employee breakdown of key technology companies
-Examining employee breakdowns of key technology companies reveals a significant underrepresentation of women. This data underscores the need for diversity initiatives to create a more inclusive and equitable tech industry.



## Ask the question: Why diversity matters to your tech company



1. When are diversity efforts most successful?
-Diversity matters because it brings together different perspectives, experiences, and knowledge sets. This fosters creativity, innovation, and problem-solving, leading to better products and services that cater to a wider range of users.

Diversity efforts are most successful when implemented holistically, focusing on recruitment, retention, and building an inclusive workplace culture. This involves unconscious bias training, flexible work arrangements, and mentorship programs.




2. Why do diverse companies perform better?
-Studies show that diverse companies perform better financially. This is attributed to increased creativity, improved decision-making, and a wider talent pool.


3. Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.
-A diverse team of developers with varying cultural backgrounds can create a mobile app that accommodates language and accessibility needs of a global audience. This demonstrates how diverse teams can serve a diverse user base effectively.
