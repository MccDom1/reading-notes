what flag do you run when a ship has run aground?




The flag to run when a ship has run aground is the international distress flag, also known as the Oscar flag or the answer. It is a rectangular flag divided diagonally into two halves, with the upper triangle yellow and the lower triangle black.

The international distress flag is used to signal that a ship is in distress and needs assistance. It is the most widely recognized distress signal in the world and should be used in any situation where a ship is in danger.

In addition to the international distress flag, there are a number of other signals that can be used to indicate that a ship has run aground. These include:

The International Code of Signals (ICS) signal for "Grounding": This signal consists of three letters, G-R-D, and is used to indicate that a ship has run aground.
The ICS signal for "I require assistance": This signal consists of three letters, N-C, and is used to indicate that a ship requires assistance.
Visual distress signals, such as flares, smoke signals, and signal mirrors: These signals can be used to attract attention and signal for help.
If you see a ship that has run aground, it is important to contact the coast guard or other emergency services immediately. You should also try to provide the ship with any assistance that you can safely do so
