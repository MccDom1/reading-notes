1.Compose a short poem describing how HTTP sends data between computers

You down with HTTP? Yeah you know Me!
HTTP, a protocol so popping
Sends data between computers when your finger tips start dropping.

Requests and responses, then begins to sync,
To deliver your data, faster than you think

URLs, headers, and bodies just to name a few
HTTP creates a message specifically for you

Servers to browsers, and all those things,
HTTP sends your data, fresh and clean like listerine.

So let's take our hats off for HTTP,
For allowing our data to flow fresh and free.


2. Describe how HTML, CSS, and JS files are “parsed” in the browser.

When a web browser loads a web page, it needs to parse the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files in order to render the page correctly. Parsing is the process of breaking down the code into smaller pieces that the browser can understand.
HTML parsing:

The browser starts by parsing the HTML file. This involves identifying the different elements in the HTML code, such as div, p, and img. The browser also needs to understand the relationships between the different elements. For example, the browser needs to know that the img element is a child of the div element.

Once the browser has parsed the HTML code, it can start to build the Document Object Model (DOM). The DOM is a tree-like structure that represents the content of the web page. Each element in the HTML code corresponds to a node in the DOM.

CSS parsing:

Once the browser has parsed the HTML code and built the DOM, it can start to parse the CSS files. The CSS files contain the styling information for the web page. The browser uses this information to determine how to render the different elements in the DOM.

The browser starts by parsing the CSS files line by line. It identifies the different CSS selectors and properties, and it builds a CSS Object Model (CSSOM). The CSSOM is a data structure that represents the styling information for the web page.

JavaScript parsing:

Once the browser has parsed the HTML and CSS files, it can start to parse the JavaScript files. JavaScript is a programming language that can be used to add interactivity to web pages.

The browser parses the JavaScript files line by line. It identifies the different JavaScript statements and expressions, and it builds a JavaScript Object Model (JSOM). The JSOM is a data structure that represents the JavaScript code for the web page.

Once the browser has parsed the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, it can start to render the web page. This involves using the DOM, CSSOM, and JSOM to determine how to display the content of the web page.

3.How can you find images to add to a Website?

There are many ways to find images to add to a website. Here are a few options:

Use a stock photo website. There are many websites that offer stock photos, which are high-quality images that can be used for commercial purposes. Some popular stock photo websites include Unsplash, Pexels, and Pixabay.
Take your own photos. If you have a good camera and some photography skills, you can take your own photos to use on your website. Be sure to edit your photos before using them so that they look their best.
Use a photo editing software. There are many photo editing software programs that you can use to create your own images. These programs can be used to edit existing photos, create graphics, or even create digital art.
Use a free image search engine. There are many free image search engines that you can use to find images for your website. Be sure to check the copyright status of any images you find before using them on your website.

4.How do you create a String vs a Number in JavaScript?
To create a string in JavaScript, you can use single quotes ('), double quotes ("), or backticks (`).

5.What is a Variable and why are they important in JavaScript?

A variable in JavaScript is a named storage for data. It can be used to store any type of data, such as numbers, strings, objects, and arrays. Variables are important in JavaScript because they allow you to store data and reuse it throughout your code.
To create a variable in JavaScript, you use the var, let, or const keyword followed by the variable name. 

                   INTRO TO HTML

1.What is an HTML attribute?

An HTML attribute is a piece of information that is associated with an HTML element. Attributes are used to define the appearance and behavior of HTML elements.

2.Anatomy of an HTML element

An HTML element is a building block of an HTML document. Elements are used to define the content and structure of an HTML document.

The basic anatomy of an HTML element is as follows:

HTML
<element-name attribute1="value1" attribute2="value2" ...>
content
</element-name>


3.Difference between <article> and <section> element tags

The <article> and <section> element tags are both used to define sections of an HTML document. However, there is a subtle difference between the two tags.

The <article> tag is used to define a self-contained piece of content that can be independently distributed or syndicated. For example, a blog post or a news article would be a good example of an <article>.

The <section> tag is used to define a section of an HTML document that is related to the rest of the document but is not self-contained. For example, the header, footer, and sidebar of a web page would be good examples of <section>s.

Elements in a typical website

A typical website includes the following elements:

<!DOCTYPE html>: This declaration tells the browser that the document is an HTML document.
<html> and </html>: These tags define the beginning and end of the HTML document.
<head> and </head>: These tags contain information about the HTML document, such as the title, meta tags, and links to CSS and JavaScript files.
<body> and </body>: These tags contain the visible content of the HTML document, such as paragraphs, images, and links.

5. How does metadata influence Search Engine Optimization?

Search engines use metadata to index and rank web pages. By providing accurate and informative metadata, you can help your website rank higher in search engine results pages (SERPs).

Some of the most important metadata for SEO include:

Title tag: This tag defines the title of your web page and is displayed in the SERPs.
Meta description: This tag provides a brief description of your web page and is also displayed in the SERPs.
Meta keywords: This tag contains a list of keywords that are relevant to your web page.

6.How is the <meta> HTML tag used when specifying metadata?

The <meta> HTML tag is used to specify metadata for an HTML document. The <meta> tag always goes inside the <head> element of an HTML document.

                           How to start to design a Website.
1.What is the first step to designing a Website?

The first step to designing a website is to define your goals. What do you want your website to achieve? Do you want to sell products or services? Do you want to share information or educate your visitors? Do you want to build a community around your brand? Once you know your goals, you can start to think about the design and structure of your website.

2.What is the most important question to answer when designing a Website?

The most important question to answer when designing a website is: Who is your target audience? Who are you trying to reach with your website? What are their needs and interests? Once you know your target audience, you can tailor the design and content of your website to appeal to them.

                       Semantics.

1.Why should you use an <h1> element over a <span> element to display a top level heading?
There are a few reasons why you should use an <h1> element over a <span> element to display a top-level heading:

Semantic meaning: The <h1> element tells the browser that the text within it is the most important heading on the page. This helps the browser to understand the structure of the page and to display it correctly.
Accessibility: Screen readers use semantic tags to help users navigate web pages. When a screen reader encounters an <h1> element, it knows that it is the most important heading on the page and announces it accordingly. This helps users to quickly understand the structure of the page and to find the information they are looking for.
SEO: Search engines also use semantic tags to rank web pages. When a search engine encounters an <h1> element, it knows that it is the most important heading on the page and gives it more weight in its ranking algorithm. This can help your website to rank higher in search results pages (SERPs).

2.What are the benefits of using semantic tags in our HTML?

here are many benefits to using semantic tags in HTML, including:

Improved accessibility: Semantic tags help screen readers to understand the structure of a web page and to announce it accordingly. This makes it easier for people with visual impairments to navigate and understand web pages.
Improved SEO: Search engines use semantic tags to rank web pages. By using semantic tags, you can help your website to rank higher in search results pages (SERPs).
More maintainable code: Semantic tags make it easier to understand and maintain HTML code. When you use semantic tags, the code is more self-documenting and easier to read and understand.
Improved user experience: Semantic tags help browsers to display web pages correctly. This results in a better user experience for all visitors, regardless of the device they are using.
Overall, using semantic tags in HTML is a good practice that can improve the accessibility, SEO, maintainability, and user experience of your website.
                  What is JavaScript?

1.Describe 2 things that require JavaScript in the Browser?

Interactive elements: JavaScript is used to create interactive elements on web pages, such as menus, buttons, and forms. For example, when you click on a button and something happens, it's likely JavaScript that's making it happen.
Dynamic content: JavaScript can be used to dynamically update the content of a web page without having to reload the page. For example, a shopping cart that updates as you add items to it is likely using JavaScript to do so.


2.How can you add JavaScript to an HTML document?

Inline JavaScript: You can add JavaScript code directly to your HTML document using the <script> tag. 

External JavaScript files: You can also add JavaScript code to your HTML document by referencing an external JavaScript file.
