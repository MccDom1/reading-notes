3. Explain the basic structure and properties of NumPy arrays, and provide examples of how to create, manipulate, and perform operations on them.

- Basic Structure:

NumPy arrays consist of elements of the same data type organized in a grid.
They have attributes like shape, size, and dimensions.
Arrays can be one-dimensional, two-dimensional, or multi-dimensional.
Creating NumPy Arrays:

python
Copy code
import numpy as np

# Creating an array from a list
arr1 = np.array([1, 2, 3])

# Creating a 2D array with zeros
arr2 = np.zeros((3, 4))

# Creating an array with a range of values
arr3 = np.arange(0, 10, 2)
Manipulating Arrays:

python
Copy code
# Reshaping an array
reshaped_arr = arr2.reshape((2, 6))

# Slicing an array
sliced_arr = arr3[1:4]

# Performing element-wise operations
result = arr1 * 2
In summary, NumPy's key features lie in its array manipulation capabilities, mathematical functions, and support for scientific computing, making it indispensable for tasks involving data analysis and numerical operations in Python. Understanding the basic structure and operations on NumPy arrays is essential for leveraging its power in various programming scenarios.
