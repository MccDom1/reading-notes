# Read: Class 03

## Why is this important?

- It is important to know how to read files in Python. understanding file I/O and exception handling is fundamental for building robust and reliable software. It enables developers to create applications that handle data efficiently, manage resources effectively, and respond gracefully to unexpected situations, contributing to the overall success and usability of the software.

## Readings: FileIO & Exceptions



1. What is the purpose of the ‘with’ statement when opening a file in Python, and how does it help manage resources while reading and writing files?

- It helps manage resources while reading and writing files. It ensures that the file is closed after the program is done with it. It also ensures that the file is closed even if an exception occurs. 

2. Explain the difference between the ‘read()’ and ‘readline()’ methods for file objects in Python. Provide examples of when to use each method.

- The read() method reads the entire file and returns it as a single string. The readline() method reads a single line of the file and returns it as a string. 

3. Briefly describe the concept of exception handling in Python. How can the ‘try’, ‘except’, and ‘finally’ blocks be used to handle exceptions and ensure proper execution of code? Provide a simple example.

- Exception handling is the process of responding to errors that occur during the execution of a program. It is used to handle errors that occur during the execution of a program. The try block is used to specify the code that might cause an error. The except block is used to specify the code that will be executed if an error occurs in the try block. The finally block is used to specify the code that will be executed regardless of whether an error occurs in the try block.
