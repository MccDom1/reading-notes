# Engineering Readings

1. What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?

- I bring a deep understanding of the business domain and the technical domain. My unique life experiences, background, and personal perspectives bring a distinctive viewpoint to the career that no one else can replicate. Whether it's a specific set of skills, diverse cultural insights, or a unique problem-solving approach, this individuality sets me apart and enriches a team's dynamics. The ability to navigate challenges and continuously learn is a valuable trait in the dynamic field of coding and software development i feel. So i Embrace collaboration, breaking down problems, and maintaining a commitment to learning will empower you to overcome obstacles and contribute meaningfully to my work.

2. What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?

- Team Collaboration for Problem-Solving:

Whenever I'm stuck on a tricky piece of code or logic, I'll reach out to colleagues or online communities. Collaborating with others brings different viewpoints to the table, often leading to innovative solutions. Working together is a powerful way to tackle challenges.
Break It Down and Take Breaks:

To tackle complex problems, I'll break them into smaller, more manageable tasks. If I hit a roadblock, stepping away for a short break is crucial. It helps clear my mind, and often, returning with a fresh outlook allows me to see the problem in a new light.
Embrace Continuous Learning:

I'll adopt a mindset of continuous learning.
 When faced with tough coding issues, I'll invest time in researching relevant documentation, articles, or tutorials. Engaging with online resources and communities not only helps in the moment but also ensures ongoing skill enhancement.
In a field as dynamic as coding, the ability to adapt, collaborate, and persistently learn is key. My commitment to teamwork, problem breakdown, and continuous learning will be instrumental in navigating challenges and making meaningful contributions.
