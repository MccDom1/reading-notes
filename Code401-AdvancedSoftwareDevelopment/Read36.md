2. From the “6 tips to ace a whiteboard programming interview” article, can you identify and explain at least two strategies that can help improve your performance during a whiteboard programming interview?

- From the "6 Tips to Ace a Whiteboard Programming Interview" Article:

Break Down the Problem: Instead of immediately diving into writing code, take the time to understand and break down the problem into smaller, manageable parts. Discuss your approach with the interviewer, identify edge cases, and clarify requirements before starting to code. Breaking down the problem helps ensure that you have a clear plan before writing any code, reducing the likelihood of errors and making your solution more organized.

Write Pseudocode First: Before writing actual code, outline your solution using pseudocode. Pseudocode helps you structure your thoughts and algorithms logically without getting bogged down by language syntax. It allows you to focus on the high-level design of your solution before translating it into actual code, making your implementation smoother and more efficient.
