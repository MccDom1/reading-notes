# Terminal Practice

1. ## The Command Line

What I Learned:
The command line is like a chat with the computer.
It helps you do things on the computer by typing commands.
You can open it on Linux by starting a program called the terminal.
2. ## Basic Navigation
What I Learned:
The computer's files are organized like a tree.
Commands like ls show what's in a folder, and cd moves you around.
cd .. moves you up one level in the folders.
3. ## More About Files
What I Learned:
Files and folders have permissions for who can do what.
You can change these permissions with commands like chmod.
File extensions can tell you what kind of file it is.
4. ## Manual Pages
What I Learned:
You can learn about commands by typing man and the command name.
Manuals give you lots of details about how to use a command.
Use arrow keys to navigate, and type q to exit.
5. ## File Manipulation
What I Learned:
You can make empty files with touch and new folders with mkdir.
Be careful with rm because it deletes things.
mv renames or moves, and cp copies.
Wildcards like * can do things to lots of files at once.
