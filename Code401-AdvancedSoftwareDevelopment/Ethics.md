Reflections on Ethics in Technology Readings
"Project Dragonfly, Google’s Censored Search Engine"
This article discusses Google's controversial Project Dragonfly, which aimed to develop a censored search engine for the Chinese market. It raises ethical concerns regarding censorship, freedom of information, and collaboration with authoritarian regimes. The article highlights the tension between corporate interests, such as market expansion and profitability, and ethical principles, such as respect for human rights and freedom of expression. I strongly disagree with Google's decision to pursue Project Dragonfly, as it compromises fundamental ethical values in favor of business opportunities. What stood out to me was the internal dissent and public backlash against the project, demonstrating the importance of ethical considerations in technology development and the power of public scrutiny in holding tech companies accountable.

"Self-Driving Car Ethics"
This article explores the ethical dilemmas surrounding self-driving cars, particularly regarding decisions made by autonomous vehicles in life-threatening situations. It discusses the challenges of programming moral principles into AI systems and the implications for human safety and liability. The article raises thought-provoking questions about who bears responsibility in the event of accidents involving self-driving cars and the ethical trade-offs involved in programming decision-making algorithms. While I agree that self-driving car technology holds the potential to save lives and improve transportation efficiency, I also acknowledge the ethical complexities inherent in designing AI systems to make life-and-death decisions. What struck me was the need for transparent ethical frameworks and regulatory oversight to guide the development and deployment of self-driving cars, ensuring that safety and ethical considerations remain paramount.
