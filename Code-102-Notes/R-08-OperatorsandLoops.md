R-08 Operations and Loops

In summary, Operations are used to perform calculations and manipulate data. Loops are used to repeat a block of code until a certain condition is met. This can be useful for tasks such as iterating over a list of items or performing a calculation multiple times.

1.What is an expression in JavaScript?

-An expression in JavaScript is a combination of variables, operators, and function calls that evaluates to a value. Expressions can be used in a variety of ways, such as in assignments, function calls, and conditional statements.
ex.
1 + 2
"Hello, world!"
myFunction(1, 2, 3)

2.Why would we use a loop in our code?

-We use loops in our code to repeat a block of code until a certain condition is met. This can be useful for tasks such as iterating over a list of items or performing a calculation multiple times.

3.When does a for loop stop executing?

-A for loop stops executing when the loop condition is no longer true.

How many times will a while loop execute?

-The number of times a while loop executes depends on the loop condition. If the loop condition is always true, the loop will execute infinitely. If the loop condition is never true, the loop will never execute.

ex;
while (true) {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
}.   This loop will continue to execute until the program is terminated.

while (false) {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
}.         This loop will never execute because the loop condition is always false.
